###whatsOn

whatsOn is a new application to help manage your various video streaming platforms in one simple and convenient application. 

Once a user makes a profile, they are shown new movies that are available on the streaming services they use.
The user is able to see the poster, plot, genres, and critic score, as well as the subscription service or services that film is on. 
This is accomplished by retrieving data from both the Guidebox and OMDB APIs.


Users can search for a film, and see what subscription services that the film is on, even if it is not a service that they subscribe to.


Streaming content is great, but the latest and greatest films take months before they are available online. 
Using whatsOn, users are also able to see what films are playing in theaters near them by using the Gracenote API




Continual development will make whatsOn a much more robust application. 
In this state, the application is limited by the restrictions of the Guidebox API. 
Currently, searching is a slow and complicated process that is made difficult by the limited API.
By adding a database to the application and periodically pulling the complete list of films, the deveoplment team will be able to add many useful features and greatly improve the performance of the application.

Features such as:
-Getting user genre preferences and displaying recommended films on main page
-Searching by genre, actor, year, and many other parameters
-Login system
